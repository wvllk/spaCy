Entity Extraction Upon Ingest

The script provided is a Python program that extracts entities such as hashtags, mentions, and named entities from a given text using Spacy, 
a popular open-source natural language processing library. The extracted entities are returned as a dictionary containing the text, start and end positions, 
and entity type. The script also uses regular expressions to extract hashtags and mentions that may not be identified by Spacy, and it uses the emoji 
library to extract emojis from the input text.
The script would be a useful addition to a Github portfolio for anyone interested in natural language processing or social media analytics, as it 
demonstrates proficiency in using Spacy and regular expressions for entity extraction. Additionally, it provides an example of how to integrate different 
libraries in Python to extract information from unstructured text data.
